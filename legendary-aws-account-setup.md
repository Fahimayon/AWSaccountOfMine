## AWS Free Tier

When you sign up to AWS, you automatically get access to...$100USD in AWS credits for 6 months and also allows to earn up to $200 USD in credits. Which is very helpful for someone like me to practice cloud operations for free for sometime. Although the free tier has some limitations but i will make it as useful as i can.

The AWS Free Tier includes three different types of free offers
1️⃣ 12 Months Free
Available only for the first 12 months after you create an AWS account.

You get limited usage per month, free for one year.

Examples:

EC2: 750 hours/month of a t2.micro or t3.micro instance

S3: 5 GB standard storage

RDS: 750 hours of db.t2.micro

ELB: 750 hours

📌 If you stay within the limits → no charge
📌 After 12 months → standard pricing applies

2️⃣ Always Free

Available forever, even after the first 12 months (with monthly limits).

Examples:

AWS Lambda:

1 million requests/month

400,000 GB-seconds of compute time

DynamoDB:

25 GB storage

CloudWatch:

10 custom metrics

SNS:

1 million publishes/month

📌 Best for serverless apps, learning, and small projects

3️⃣ Free Trials

Short-term trials for specific services, starting when you activate them.

Examples:

Amazon SageMaker: 2 months free (limited hours)

Amazon Redshift: Free for a limited time

Amazon Lex / Rekognition: Trial cre

✅ After my 12-month Free Tier period ends, I’ll still have access to…

Always Free services, such as:

AWS Lambda (1M requests/month)

DynamoDB (25 GB storage)

CloudWatch (limited metrics)

SNS (limited usage)

All AWS services, but now under normal pay-as-you-go pricing

My existing resources and data (nothing is deleted automatically)

❌ I’ll stop getting free access to…

12-Months Free services, including:

EC2 micro instances (750 hours/month)

RDS micro database instances

Free ELB hours

Free S3 storage beyond Always Free limits

Any usage that exceeds Always Free limits

➡️ These services will start charging immediately once the free period ends.

⏰ To make sure I remember this date, I will…

Check my AWS account creation date in the Billing Dashboard

Set a calendar reminder (with alerts 1 week before)

Enable AWS Billing Alerts and Budget alarms

Regularly review usage in AWS Cost Explorer
